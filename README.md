# Transfer-learning-projects
This is for a course assignment, using transfer learning to achieve high accuracy of scene classification. 


ResNetV4 is the best model I trained. 
This model can achieve __0.925__ accuracy steadily over the test set. 



To use ResNet152V4.cpkt use getResnet152V4
To use ResNet152V2.cpkt use getResnet152V2
