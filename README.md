# Transfer-learning-projects
This is for a course assignment, using transfer learning to achieve high accuracy of scene classification. 


This project test different models on scene classification, and transfer learning on ResNet152 scores the highest. 
This model can achieve __0.925__ accuracy steadily over the test set. 



To use ResNet152V4.cpkt use getResnet152V4
To use ResNet152V2.cpkt use getResnet152V2
